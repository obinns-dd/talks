# Check yo device
## NSLondon @ Apple Battersea

I gave a talk called ″Check yo device″ for NSLondon meetup at Apple Battersea, London.

### Overview

The talk covered Apple’s DeviceCheck framework, asymmetric cryptography, a reference implementation of App Attest and some industry standards for client attestation.

### Slides

The slides for this talk can be found [in this repository](Slides.pdf).

The talk was based on sample code I created:
