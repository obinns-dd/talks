# I’m Oliver: Let me prove it!
## iO**SK**onf 2025

I gave a talk about digital identity on Thu 15<sup>th</sup> at iO**SK**onf 25 in Skopje, North Macedonia.

### Overview

Governments across the world are now issuing credentials so we can prove our identity from mobile wallets.
We need to know our data is safe and can’t be impersonated but how can you trust who I say I am?
How can I prove my name without sharing my address? Mobile identity is the key.

### Slides

The slides for this talk can be found [in this repository](Slides.pdf).

### Resources

My talk was based on the following industry specifications:

- [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html)
- [OpenID for Verifiable Presentations](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html)
- [Digital Credentials](https://w3c-fedid.github.io/digital-credentials/)
- [Verifiable Credential Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/)
- [Bitstring Status List](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/)
- [ISO/IEC 18013-5 : Mobile driving licence (mDL) application](https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html)

I used these reference implementations for my live demos:

- [EU Digital Identity Wallet](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-app-ios-wallet-ui)
- [openwallet-foundation-labs/identity-credential](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation-labs/identity-credential)

I’m also keeping an eye on the [Digital Credentials API](https://digitalcredentials.dev) being built into major browsers.

For further reading, I would recommend chapters 4-6 from Richard Pope’s book [Platformland](https://londonpublishingpartnership.co.uk/books/platformland-an-anatomy-of-next-generation-public-services).
