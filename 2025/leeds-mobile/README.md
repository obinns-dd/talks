# Building the Foundations
## Leeds Mobile - June 2025

I gave a talk about Apple’s Foundation Models framework on Tue 17<sup>th</sup> June at [Leeds Mobile](https://www.leedsmobile.com) in Leeds, UK.

### Overview

The talk covered Apple’s approach to AI including ensuring safety and making it easy for developers to integrate Foundation Models into their apps.

I explained how to integrate the models into your app, how to test your integrations and ensure they are safe, and what I hope Apple add in the future.
