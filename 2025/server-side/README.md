# Trust but verify
## ServerSide.swift 2025

I gave a lightning talk called ″Trust but verify″ on Fri 3<sup>rd</sup> Oct at ServerSide.swift in London, UK.

### Overview

The talk covered Apple’s DeviceCheck framework - specifically a reference implementation for App Attest.

### Slides

The slides for this talk can be found [in this repository](Slides.pdf).

### Resources

The talk was based on sample code I created:

- [App Attest Sample Code](https://github.com/oliver-binns/app-attest)

For any implementations, you should also refer to the Apple Developer documentation:
