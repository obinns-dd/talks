# Scaling Mobile during a Global Pandemic
## plSwift

I gave a talk about some of [our work with NHS Digital during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://bima.co.uk/bima10-winner-covid-19-national-testing-programme-mobile-apps-by-deloitte/) on 31<sup>st</sup> May at plSwift in Warsaw.

### Overview

The talk covered how we developed and scaled a suite of mobile applications for the UK's COVID-19 National Testing Program during the pandemic.
The presentation detailed our journey from creating two initial apps in a single project to eventually managing seven interconnected apps with shared codebases, all deployed weekly for over two years (totaling 349 releases)

I explained how we implemented extensive automation for testing and deployment, overcame architectural challenges through modularization, and managed technical debt while meeting urgent deadlines.
The project, which won recognition as one of the top 10 projects of 2021 by the British Interactive Media Association (BIMA), helped process over 160 million COVID tests and significantly reduced testing site check-in times from three minutes to 30 seconds.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
