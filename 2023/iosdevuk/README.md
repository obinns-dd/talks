# Turn-based games using SharePlay
## iOSDevUK

I gave a talk about creating an iOS card game with SharePlay on 18<sup>th</sup> January at iOSDevUK in Aberystwyth.

### Overview

The talk covered Apple’s GroupActivities framework that enables SharePlay - what it is, and how to use it. It talked through an example implementation of my Face Cards app (available on the App Store). Finally, it covered what’s new in iOS 17 and visionOS.

### Slides
