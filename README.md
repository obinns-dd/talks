## About me

I am an experienced software engineer specialising in native iOS development with Swift, holding an Master of Engineering degree in Computer Science from the University of York. 
As a Manager at Deloitte Digital, I leads teams delivering high-profile mobile apps primarily within the public sector.
My work has included scaling a public sector app from the very first lines of code to multiple cross-functional feature teams, reaching #1 on the App Store and Google Play.

Beyond iOS, I have a broad set of technical knowledge covering Android (Java, Kotlin, Unity/C#) and web technologies (Angular, PHP, JS, Python). 
I was shortlisted for Engineer of the Year at the BCS UK IT Industry Awards 2024, am international conference speaker, and actively contribute to the open-source community. 
In 2015 and 2015, I received scholarships to Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).
